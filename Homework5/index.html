      <h1>Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
      <p>
        Bohemiasn Rhapsody is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their music
        and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury. Freddie defied
        stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the most beloved
        entertainers on the planet. The film traces the meteoric rise of the
        band through their iconic songs and revolutionary sound. They reach
        unparalleled success, but in an unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by
        darker influences, shuns Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having
        suffered greatly without the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to
        reunite with his bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely
        facing a recent AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the
        greatest performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a
        legacy that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to
        this day
