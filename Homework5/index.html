            Bohemian Rhapsody is a foot-stomping celebration of Queen, their
            music and their extraordinary lead singer Freddie Mercury. Freddie
            defied stereotypes and shattered convention to become one of the
            most beloved entertainers on the planet. The film traces the
            meteoric rise of the band through their iconic songs and
            revolutionary sound. They reach unparalleled success, but in an
            unexpected turn Freddie, surrounded by darker influences, shuns
            Queen in pursuit of his solo career. Having suffered greatly without
            the collaboration of Queen, Freddie manages to reunite with his
            bandmates just in time for Live Aid. While bravely facing a recent
            AIDS diagnosis, Freddie leads the band in one of the greatest
            performances in the history of rock music. Queen cements a legacy
            that continues to inspire outsiders, dreamers and music lovers to
            this day
