          <h1>Welcome to Rover Rescue</h1>
          <p>
            Rover Rescue is a non-profit organization founded in 2001 to save as
            many homeless dogs as we can and place them in permanent and loving
            homes. We know that somewhere nearby a person or family yearns for
            one of these special dogs.
            <br />
            From the moment we rescue a dog we start changing its life for the
            better:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each dog is placed in a caring foster home or boarded until the
              right owner is found.
            </li>
            <li>
              During their stay with Rover Rescue, volunteers walk, socialize
              and give these dogs the loving care they need.
            </li>
            <li>Injured or sick dogs are given proper medical attention.</li>
            <li>
              Dogs are vaccinated, spayed or neutered, and even given “beauty
              makeovers”.
            </li>
            <li>
              We make a special effort to match prospective owners with the
              right dog during the adoption process to make sure each of our
              dogs will never become homeless again. And we help educate new
              owners on the proper care of their new best friends.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In addition, Rover Rescue works hard in our community to reduce
            animal overpopulation and increase vital awareness about responsible
            pet ownership. We actively support spaying and neutering of all
            companion dogs and offer spay/neuter financial assistance to
            low-income families.
            <br />
            There are many ways you can pitch in to transform the lives of dogs
            and humans, and make happy tails come true – 100% of our support
            comes from donations and volunteers. Help us keep going...
            <br /><em>until every dog has a home.</em>
